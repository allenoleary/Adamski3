<p>From the article:</p>
<p>Stemming from a lifelong obsession with printed matter dating back to the 1950s, Adam Dix seeks to encapsulate the conflict between the fervent desire for new technology and our nostalgic yearnings for simpler times. His paintings radiate an eerie glow, reminiscent of television screens from the past – flickering tubes and distorted form. Inks and glazes layered in sugared almond pastel shades, with carefully chosen colour seeping and spreading over the gesso covered panels.</p>

<p>Following on from the success of his sell-out show at London’s Haunch of Venison during the winter of 2010, his work caught the eye of numerous international art collectors and has been exhibited widely throughout the last year. Alongside his collaborative work with Other Criteria, Dix has recently been nominated for the highly coveted Sovereign Art Prize. New work will be showcased in May 2012 at Mayfair’s Sumarria Lunn gallery.</p>
