Project Based Residencies at Griffin Gallery are shorter residencies offering artists studio space, materials and specialised knowledge. Artists are encouraged to develop innovative projects focussed on the interaction, composition or application of Fine Art materials.

<i>'The physicality of paint is historically loaded and can sometimes seem bombastic or slight in application. This is something that I have purposely avoided through out my painting career by means of process and economy of application, which I believe is a key part to the discussion and narrative of the work.'</i>

My aim whilst a resident at Griffin was to further the already inherent layering process within the work and extend it’s economic language by creating works that had an optical depth and visual “pull and push” between figurative and abstract forms within the painting, through shallow layering of paint.
