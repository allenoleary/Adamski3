        <title>Griffin Residency</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Project Based Residencies at Griffin Gallery are shorter residencies offering artists studio space, materials and specialised knowledge. Artists are encouraged to develop innovative projects focussed on the interaction, composition or application of Fine Art materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘The physicality of paint is historically loaded and can sometimes seem bombastic or slight in application. This is something that I have purposely avoided through out my painting career by means of process and economy of application, which I believe is a key part to the discussion and narrative of the work.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My aim whilst a resident at Griffin was to further the already inherent layering process within the work and extend it’s economic language by creating works that had an optical depth and visual “pull and push” between figurative and abstract forms within the painting, through shallow layering of paint.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Eleven gallery presents</title>
        <description>&lt;h4&gt;Eleven&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eleven is delighted to present Printed Matter, an exhibition dedicated to limited edition prints. The exhibition features work by select gallery artists alongside some of contemporary art’s most prominent artists. The artists featured in Printed Matter are Charles Avery, Peter Blake, Jake &amp;amp; Dinos Chapman, Adam Dix, Shepard Fairey, Damien Hirst, Gary Hume, Natasha Law, Grayson Perry, Keith Tyson and Jonathan Yeo.&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      Charles Avery’s set of lithographs Place de la Revolution are studies of cyclists. Each cyclist exists in isolation from their environment, inciting questioning to which true contexts they may belong. These works act as a microcosm of Avery’s artistic practice which is dedicated to all facets of life on a fictitious island.&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      Peter Blake’s recently published etchings Elvis Two Rivers (2014) and Liberty Beauty Rose (2014)&lt;br /&gt;
      are new additions to his seminal series of wood engravings from the 1970’s featuring circus and fairground entertainment imagery, subject matter which Blake has revered throughout his life. These prints reflect Blake’s first return to etching in over two decades.&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      Jake &amp;amp; Dinos Chapman’s Etchasketchathon etching series (2005) perverts children’s colouring books, turning innocent scenes into gruesome nightmares. Mixing found imagery with intricate drawings; each image evokes a hellish childhood where kids, bears and clowns become dangerous creatures ready for the worst.&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      Adam Dix’s work explores our associations between communication technology and our absorption with it. He examines the disparity between our desire to communicate and the physical isolation of others that technology can engender. This is exaggerated by appropriating similar traits found in the genres of science fiction, folk lore, and religion, by exploring ideas of ritual and ceremony to emphasize a sense of compliance or worship.&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      Shepard Fairey’s set of silkscreen and gold foil-block prints Power and Glory (2014) explores themes of allegiance, influence and authority in America. The American flag serves as the basis for the works before Fairey reinterprets the iconic pervasive design both aesthetically and conceptually.&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      Damien Hirst’s Doxylamine (2007) and Flumequine (2007) form part of his series of ‘spot’ paintings and prints. They are titled after pharmaceuticals and each work reflects a highly manufactured process where they are crafted so no two colours are the same.&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      Gary Hume’s linocut print Paradise Five (2012) features an umber coloured bird emerging from the dark background. Through employing his stylistically distinguishing flat colours and clean organic lines the elegant but simplified form emerges.&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      Natasha Law's signature semi-nudes work as snapshots of the intimate. She allows her forms to materialise through her descriptive lines and single blocks of colour. Law has become known for her figurative works of females often in an act of undress, provocatively capturing these fleeting moments of both vulnerability and intimacy.&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      Grayson Perry uses the medieval mappa mundi model to chart his beliefs and social commentary in Map of Nowhere (2008). In immense detail, he satirically comments on current events and the paraphernalia of modern life. From people praying to corporations to tabloid catch phrases strategically placed within the work, Perry utilises an antiquated craft to enlighten our contemporary world.&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      Keith Tyson’s prints are taken from his Studio Wall Drawings which he produced over the course of fifteen years. Together they present the artist’s journal, recording events, moods, ideas and people which entered his sphere of thinking throughout the years. Varying stylistically they act as a visual manifestation of a single expression of thought.&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      Jonathan Yeo’s latest limited edition prints feature portraits of Lily Cole and Helena Bonham Carter along with Silvio Berlusconi created in Yeo’s porn collage style. One of the most prominent portrait painters of our time, Yeo’s work has been widely exhibited internationally.&lt;br /&gt;

        <title>So long and thanks for all the fish</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;From the catalogue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adam Dix's neo-futurist paintings speak of a time of historical optimism, when absolute faith was put into new communication devices; embraced as powerful spiritual icons for the modern age, which deserved to be worshipped and revered. The collective awe and wonder is palpable; any sense of individuality is forgotten in the group dynamic. Using a muted palette and strong, dramatic lighting, Dix's fictive landscapes seem to be taken from a post-apocalyptic world. Satellite discs take on the role of haloes or crop circles and phone masts totems or flags; lead characters are disguised by wearing Shaman-like masks and costumes. The merging of folklore, local religion and science fiction throw us into an uncertain future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>News from the sun</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;From the catalogue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thirty years ago, a short story called News From the Sun appeared in JG Ballard’s collection Myths of the Near Future. Like much of his fiction, this tale of social and temporal entropy is peppered with references to solar collectors, light aircraft and relics of a defunct space programme. The story is pervaded both by a sense of ‘nostalgia for the future’ (as one character describes it) and by the relentless and all consuming glare of the sun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This exhibition brings together four artists who, in a variety of ways, display an interest in subverted or obsolete modernity, referencing technology, architecture and design that offer up optimistic promises of a utopian future. Their work can be seen to explore a sense of nostalgia for the future through references that oscillate between the aesthetics of 20th century science fiction, cold war propaganda and fin-de-siècle modernity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adam Dix – Science Fiction Futures?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;From the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stemming from a lifelong obsession with printed matter dating back to the 1950s, Adam Dix seeks to encapsulate the conflict between the fervent desire for new technology and our nostalgic yearnings for simpler times. His paintings radiate an eerie glow, reminiscent of television screens from the past – flickering tubes and distorted form. Inks and glazes layered in sugared almond pastel shades, with carefully chosen colour seeping and spreading over the gesso covered panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from the success of his sell-out show at London’s Haunch of Venison during the winter of 2010, his work caught the eye of numerous international art collectors and has been exhibited widely throughout the last year. Alongside his collaborative work with Other Criteria, Dix has recently been nominated for the highly coveted Sovereign Art Prize. New work will be showcased in May 2012 at Mayfair’s Sumarria Lunn gallery.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Complete article from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inventorymagazine.com/&quot;&gt;Inventory Magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stumbled across the work of Adam Dix by accident, during a particularly dismal day in London last winter. The rain poured, the winds howled, and the clouds cast menacing shadows over Mayfair. Th e morning had been spent with a friend from Wigan, checking out the exhibitions on Cork Street, armed with a shoddy golf umbrella. We ducked into the Haunch of Venison shortly before closing time, and squelched up the magnificent staircase to see Transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/test/images/i_10.jpg&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; class=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gallery had been temporarily relocated to number six Burlington Gardens, a building made up of gargantuan rooms and double height ceilings. Against these vast white walls, his paintings were modest in scale, yet still commanded my attention. At first glance, they appeared to be nostalgic, voyeuristic documents, reminiscent of 1940s tinted photographs. Closer inspection revealed a sinister undertone to each of these mysterious anthropological scenes, and I felt compelled to understand the narrative behind them. It’s rare that I’ll return to see the same exhibition twice, but there was something so genuinely mesmerising about the palette of pastel colours he’d used to paint these warped societies, that I braved the elements a week later for a second viewing. I casually sauntered up to one of the invigilators, and asked if he thought the press department would help me to secure an interview with this young artist. Emails and phone calls ensued, and a few weeks later I was invited to meet Dix at his studio in Hackney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steel framed windows shuddered slightly each time the London Overground trains rattled past the building. It was an organised and welcoming space: the walls adorned with studies and yellowing pages torn from periodicals published some decades earlier. I noticed his canny use of old yoghurt pots as nifty paint vessels, and after cranking up the fan heaters, we started discussing
the methodology behind his paintings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When did your career as an artist begin?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an epiphany about five years ago, up in Edinburgh. I’d been thinking about going back to college to do a Masters for a while, but looking at the works of Eduardo Paolozzi in the Dean Gallery that day made me realize that now was the right time to apply. He’d always been a real hero of mine, a man whose work was a true manifestation of what he believed in. I’d originally graduated in the 1990s and started jobbing as a freelance illustrator and working as an assistant to other artists, but somehow always managed to keep on painting. Over the years I ended up pretty disillusioned by the whole thing, but the experience was immensely helpful, and it gave me a nice back catalogue to delve into from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/test/images/i_4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been around the block a few times – and not necessarily the right block, but being on the course gave me the time I needed to re-evaluate the way I painted. Apparently this is what happens on an MA – they break you down, and then they build you back up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the past decade or so, the media have repeatedly warned us about the possible dangers of mobile phone masts, or the health risks of living close to electricity pylons. Yet throughout your work, you place the characters uncomfortably close to these devices. What prompted your interest in humanity and its relationship with technology?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work had always been concerned with cities, urban culture and telecommunications. I’d grown up with the technological side of the visual and media world all around me. My mum was a freelance vision mixer, working in the television industry and my dad was a musician. I spent most of my school holidays trying to keep quiet on set when the programmes were being filmed, or sitting in those dimly lit control rooms, looking at banks of monitors and watching them switch from one camera to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/test/images/i_12.jpg&quot; width=&quot;66%&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; class=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was coupled with an ongoing interest in science fiction, and old b-movies from the 1950s. When I started researching things further, I realized the way we live now owes a lot to the psyche and the advances made by people at that time. Without the technological breakthroughs that were made during the Cold War period, we probably wouldn’t have the satellite dishes, mobile phones, and laptops that nowadays we just take for granted. Before the space race started between the US and USSR, computers were these immovable, clunky pieces of apparatus that were so colossal in size, that they filled entire rooms.
Things had to be downsized pretty swiftly so they could fit into rocket ships, ready to be launched into space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a long time studying our relationships with communication and connectivity, and started to wonder what might happen if the human race were suddenly forced to obliterate all knowledge of telecommunications and technology – and then be reintroduced to it again. I was pretty sure that the whole thing would appear disconcerting and illogical. But then, after watching films like &lt;em&gt;The Wicker Man,&lt;/em&gt; it struck me that some people would probably begin to revere these awe inspiring, incongruous monuments. I imagined entire communities starting to display cult-like behaviourisms, worshipping these bizarre relics of a bygone era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/test/images/i_11.jpg&quot; width=&quot;66%&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look at most science fiction, the subtext is nearly always concerned with the trials and tribulations of communicating with people or beings beyond our planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the modes of modern telecommunication, I started to see elements of absurdity, as if there was some kind of contemporary folklore attached to it. We’ve all seen people holding their mobiles up to the heavens when they can’t get a signal – it’s almost a spiritual act. There’s even a church in London (St Lawrence Jewry) where a Christian Reverend has taken the ancient medieval custom of Plough Monday and given it an upgrade into the 21st Century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, farm-workers would attend the service to have the tools of their trade sanctified, in the hope of a healthy harvest. As I sat there and watched members of the congregation take their mobiles and laptops to the altar for a blessing by the Reverend, I couldn’t help thinking that this really was a golden moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your paintings are executed using limited, and outdated institutionalised tones. Who and what are your main influences?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work stems from a lifelong obsession with collecting old printed material from the 1950s: science-fiction books, vintage LIFE magazines, National Geographic and comics. I loved the fact that there were always these little imperfections in the way things were printed back then. Sometimes, if you hold them up to the light in a certain way, you can see they have a definite surface knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/test/images/i_2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;66%&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; class=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a continued interest in Belgian painters Michaël Borremans and Luc Tuymans. Both of them, along with artists from the Leipzig School in Germany are well known for using muted colours in their work. I’ve also been influenced by a 19th Century French printmaker called Honoré Daumier, who was been labelled by some as ‘the Michelangelo of caricature’. Literature-wise, I’m a real fan of writers like Aldous Huxley, E.M. Forster and the social historian Eric Davis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The work appears designed and constructed, as opposed to more traditional forms of painting. Was this your intention?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each piece is meticulously planned, and only executed after I’ve seen all the colour swatch tests. I need to be guaranteed that when I start layering the inks, the final results are what I expected to get. There are still times the colours will seep and spread, giving the work a glow like an old television set. I love those moments, because it all goes back to those outdated techniques and the whole character of misregistration. There is a certain kind of slipperiness to my painting – one of my old mates, who isn’t an artist called it “the controlled splodge”. I’ve always really liked that quote, a totally non-technical way of looking at my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/test/images/i_8.jpg&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get up close to one of my paintings, it suddenly disintegrates in front of you – but when you stand back, it all falls into place. The main reason for this is because there’s only so much control I have with the inks and glazes. Generally, I work with panels or canvases on the flat, using layers of gesso as a primer. Once each layer is dry, I’ll sand it down, ready to build it up again, and then start sketching onto the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not the fastest painter in the world, and because I can only paint one small area at a time, I have to be patient and wait until it dries. I tend to work on lots of different pieces at once, because otherwise, I am literally waiting for paint to dry. Occasionally I’ll have to use drying agents within the paint, and fan heaters to speed things up a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember for the Haunch show, one painting left the studio in a carry frame because it was still wet. The gallery told me afterwards that it hadn’t even been unwrapped and they’d already sold it. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2011 has been a very busy year for Dix. His acclaimed work has caught the eye of numerous international art collectors and has been exhibited widely. When asked if the success of the past year has changed things, he beams “finally, I can lock myself away and get on with it.&lt;/p&gt;
